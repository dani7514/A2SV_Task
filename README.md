# Welcome to Mobile Test
The assessment will involve enhancing features and adding code blocks to an existing mobile app.
The mobile app in question is a news application that currently displays top headlines on the home page and includes a bookmark feature, allowing users to save their favorite news articles for later reference.
## Task 1:
1, Your primary task is to implement the search functionality within the app. This involves designing a search page where users can input keywords to search for specific news articles. The search results should include the following information:
- Image of the news
- Description of the news
- Title of the news
- Author of the news

2, Additionally, you are required to add a filter icon that allows users to filter the search results based on the following criteria:
- News of the last 30 days
- News of the last 7 days
You will need to create a model for the news and implement an API request function for the search feature. Please note that there is no predefined design for this page, as we encourage you to be creative in designing the search page. The UI design that best complements the search functionality will be favored.
## Task 2:
The bookmark functionality is already implemented but requires additional code blocks to be fully functional. Your task is to ensure that the toggle function works seamlessly on the bookmark service page.
* I trust you will approach these tasks with diligence and creativity. Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to ask the examiner.
